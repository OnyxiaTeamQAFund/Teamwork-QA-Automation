# Teamwork-QA-Automation
Teamwork Project Assignment for the QA Automation Course @ SoftUni 2019

•	Register a GitHub account (http://github.com)
•	Write and assign tasks in ‘GitHub issues’ for each tasks, e.g.:
o	Writing the SRS
o	Writing a test plan 
o	Write test scenarios with test cases 
o	Start automation with Selenium WebDriver test framework
o	Make full test automation for the blog
•	Software Requirements Specification – the description of each functionality and use case of the project. Use a template for an SRS from the Internet.
•	Test project - covers everything in the project. Use template for Test scenarios and Test cases from the Internet.
•	Test framework – has to be similar to the one built throughout the course. You are free to improve the framework from the course, if you find it useful to do so.
•	Continuous Integration – upon commit changes to the code, the test project should run all tests on the new version of the project and report any bugs found.
The test project should be easily extended. When the new functionality comes, the new tests for it should be easily added to the project.
